# Alien Shooter DLC unlocker

## Installation
Copy plugin into `ur0:/tai/`  
Add the following to the `ur0:/tai/config.txt`
```
*PCSB00561
ur0:tai/alienhook.suprx
```
You need to run the game atleast once with plugin and logged into PSN for DLCs to unlock!


## Notes
This can probably work with other games that have DLC data bundled and just unlocked with purchase.
