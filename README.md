# Alien Shooter DLC unlocker

## Installation
Copy plugin into `ur0:/tai/`  
Add the following to the `ur0:/tai/config.txt`
```
#Alien Shooter DLC unlocker
#Uncomment appropriate TitleID section
#*PCSB00561 #Europe

You need to run the game atleast once with plugin for DLCs to unlock.


## Notes
This can probably work with other games that have DLC data bundled and just unlocked with purchase.
